## Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
This project is based on Kaggle Titanic competition where we have to predict whether an individual will survive or not. It consists of: -
- Data cleaning.
- Missing value imputation.
- Feature Engineering.
- Selecting the best model and
- Hyperparameter tuning.
